    "## Using PAML for phylogenetics\n",
    "For a number of you in here phylogenetics will be one of your common use points for computational biology. biopython has all these neat built ins that help you do things efficiently, without having to reinvent the wheel. \n",
    "\n",
    "Among these there exists a nice interface with the popular PAML software package. PAML allows us to perform maximum likelihood phylogenetic estimation in a flexible way. The reason it is so popular though is that it implements a number of tests for positive selection using comparisons of the rate of substitution between synonymous sites ($dS$) and nonsynonymous sites ($dN$). Briefly PAML can estimate the ratio of substitutions rates $\\omega = dN / dS$. If all mutations had no effect on fitness than we should expect these rates to be equivalent and $\\omega = 1$. If however most mutations at nonsynonymous sites were harmful and thus deleterious to the fitness of the organism, we would expect $\\omega < 1$. If on the other nonsynonymous mutations were beneficial on average we could expect $\\omega > 1$.\n",
