# Biology 399: Computational Genetics

Biology is now a computational field, where large, multidimensional datasets are the norm. In this  
class we introduce quantitative approaches to problems that arise naturally in genetics and genomics
through a computational lens. The course is project based, with each week centering around a new
problem in biology. Students will write code in Python to visualize and statistically analyze datasets
that result from modern experiments such as genome sequencing and RNA transcription profiling. 
Students are **not required** to have any previous experience with programming-- if you do have previous experience
consider this an excellent opportunity to practice "[Beginner's mind](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shoshin)". 
The course will be taught in an interactive, workshop-like environment where we will go over code together.
This environment will benefit the active participant, so please do you best during class to concentrate on the
material at hand rather than blowing it off until later (even if Andy is terribly boring). 
Below is the tentative schedule for the course. Depending on the speed we go through topics there might
be shifts in the schedule.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

### January 6. Getting Python going on your machine

Installing anaconda, jupyter notebooks, python baby steps

### January 8. Python programming language

Printing, data structures, indexing

### January 10. Python language continued

Control flow, conditionals, looping, functions. Assignment 1 handed out.

### January 13. Numpy and Scipys

Using numpy and scipy to boost our productivity. ndarrays, indexing, etc.

### January 15.  Matplotlib, plotting data

Basics of matplotlib, histograms, scatterplots, making things pretty. 

### January 17. Scipy for data, optimization, Pandas

Getting more useful with Scipy for data analysis. First looks at Pandas. Assignment 2 handed out.


### January 20. Simulation of Genetic Drift

Using our skills to simulate some the population genetic model of genetic drift.

### January 22. Biopython

Using biopython to handle sequence data. More advanced string stuff

### January 24. Scikit-allel for population genetics

Population genetic analysis using Alistair Miles' very excellent scikit-allel
package. Assignment 3.
