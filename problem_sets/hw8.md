# Homework Assignment 8
**Question 1:** Calling bullshit on bad GWAS! Okay for this week we will do something different. I want you to read an original GWAS study on a possible genetic basis for the number of years of schooling that one has (LeeEtAl2018.pdf) along with a frothing-at-the-mouth Opinion piece that appeared in the Wall Street Journal by Charles Murray (Murray_WSJ.pdf). 

After you have read through and thought about the original study and Murray's take on it I want you to write a very short essay (two paragraphs max!) on why Murray is so wrong. What is he missing in the science here? How would an understanding of GWAS help or hinder his argument?
